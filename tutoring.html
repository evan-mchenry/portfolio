            <p>From directing my high school’s writing center to teaching at Choate Rosemary Hall, I’ve always been committed to helping students excel.</p>

            <p>I graduated <em>Phi Beta Kappa</em> from Brown University with degrees in English and Literary Arts. My essays have won the Preston Gurney Fiction Prize and the Preston Gurney Poetry Prize at Brown, and I was selected as the Regional Winner in Literature for the U.S. and Canada in the Global Undergraduate Awards. My creative writing has been published in <em>The Onion</em>.</p>

            <p>I have experience working with multiple highly rated tutoring companies and now provide tutoring and editing services to students seeking independent support.</p>
