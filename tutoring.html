            <p>From directing my high school’s writing center to teaching at Choate Rosemary Hall, I’ve always been committed to helping students excel.</p>

            <p>
                I graduated <em>Phi Beta Kappa</em> from Brown University with degrees in English and Literary Arts. My essays have won the Preston Gurney Fiction Prize and the Preston Gurney Poetry Prize at Brown, and I was selected as the Regional Winner in Literature for the U.S. and Canada in the Global Undergraduate Awards. My creative writing has been published in <em>The Onion</em>.
            
            <p>
                I have experience working for multiple highly rated tutoring companies and now offer independent tutoring and editing services for new students!

    <h3>Admissions</h3>
    <p>
        Whether it’s improving SAT scores by 200 points, writing standout admissions essays, or crafting a strong profile for highly selective schools, I have experience providing support for all stages of the admissions process, from the preliminary search to the final deadlines.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>College Admissions Essays</li>
        <li>College Profile Consulting</li>
        <li>SAT</li>
        <li>ACT</li>
        <li>SHSAT</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Subject Support</h3>
    <p>
        I work with students to develop the reading, writing, and critical thinking skills that lead to lasting academic confidence and authenticity, especially in a world of AI-generated flatness.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>General ELA</li>
        <li>AP English, AP History, AP Latin</li>
        <li>Creative Writing</li>
        <li>Journalism</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Generally, I work with students in grades 6–12 and in college, though I occasionally take clients at other points in their academic journeys. I offer sessions in-person in the New York City area and virtually.
